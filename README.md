# React + Vite

### Serverless functions - proof of concept with React

This React app used code converted from a Vanilla JS app i built - see my [serverless-functions repository](https://github.com/aprentz/serverless-functions).

This app was purely focused on the successful deployment of a serverless React app including hidden API keys.
